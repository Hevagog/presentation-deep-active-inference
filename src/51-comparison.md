## Comparison with model-free reinforcement learning agents

![Comparison of the performance of DAIMC agent with DQN, A2C and PPO2. The bold line represents the mean, and shaded areas the standard deviation over multiple training runs.](img/comparison-daimc-mfrl.png){height=50%}

Note that of the two best-performing agents (DAIMC and PPO2), DAIMC has substantially less variance across training runs, indicating a more stable learning process. 
Nonetheless, these comparisons should be treated as a way of illustrating the applicability of the active inference agent operating in complex environments.
