## Motivation

A common goal in cognitive science and artificial intelligence is to emulate biological intelligence, to gain new insights into the brain and build more capable machines. A widely-studied neuroscience proposition for this is the **free-energy principle**, which views the *brain as a device performing variational (Bayesian) inference*.

Specifically, this principle provides a framework for understanding biological intelligence, termed active inference, by bringing together perception and action under a single objective:

> **minimizing free energy across time**
